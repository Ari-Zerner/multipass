MultiPass is a tool that makes it easy to generate strong, non-repetitive passwords and PINs that donâ€™t need to be stored anywhere by using an algorithm to combine a master password and a password use identifier into a password or PIN that looks random, but will always be the same if given the same master password and use identifier.
