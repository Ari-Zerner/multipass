SitePass is a tool that aims to make it easy to generate strong, non-repetitive passwords that don’t need to be stored in a list that can be found. The passwords are generated by hashing the concatenation of a master password and a site name, separated by a space. The MD5 hash was chosen arbitrarily. All instances of ‘a’, ‘c’, and ‘e’ in the generated password are capitalized in order to fulfill requirements that passwords contain capital letters.

An executable JAR file can be found in the dist folder. Source code can be found in the src folder.
